# Path Mappings with Lookahead

This repository contains the source code for the PacificVis 2025 paper

"Accelerating Computation of Stable Merge Tree Edit Distances using Parameterized Heuristics"  
Florian Wetzels, Heike Leitte and Christoph Garth  
IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 2025.  
<!---[Link to paper]()-->

The sections below contain detailed instructions on how to compile and run the code on a vanilla Ubuntu 22.04 to reproduce the teaser figure of the paper.
For simple usage, you can clone this repository and run the installation script, the data script and the python code to render the figure (details below), all from the root directory of this repository:

```bash
./install.sh
./get_data.sh
python3 compute_dm.py
```

The directory `ttk-lookahead` contains a complete ttk source with the new look-ahead extension added to the path mapping distance.
The installation script `install.sh` installs all dependencies, downloads the paraview source code and compiles paraview as well as ttk.
The data script `get_data.sh` downloads the [2D vortex street dataset](https://www.csc.kth.se/~weinkauf/notes/cylinder2d.html) and converts it to vtk files.
The python script `compute_dm.py` loads the vtk dataset, computes merge trees and distance matrices with the path mapping distance for look-ahead values of 0-3, and lastly derives t-SNE embeddings from the four matrices.

This produces four pdf files containing the distance matrices from the paper teaser, as well as four pdf files containing the t-SNE embeddings from the same figure.
All outputs are located in the root directory of the repository.
For a look-ahead value k (0-3), the two pdf are named `dm_la<k>.pdf` and `embedding_la<k>.pdf`.

## Installation Note

Tested on Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS.

### Install the dependencies

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install cmake-qt-gui libboost-system-dev libpython3.10-dev libxt-dev libxcursor-dev libopengl-dev
sudo apt-get -y install qttools5-dev libqt5x11extras5-dev libqt5svg5-dev qtxmlpatterns5-dev-tools 
sudo apt-get -y install python3-sklearn 
sudo apt-get -y install libsqlite3-dev 
sudo apt-get -y install gawk
sudo apt-get -y install git p7zip-full wget
```

### Install Paraview

First, go in the root of this repository and run the following commands:
(replace the `4` in `make -j4` by the number of available cores on your system)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk-paraview.git
cd ttk-paraview
git checkout 5.10.1
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPARAVIEW_USE_PYTHON=ON -DPARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install ..
make -j4
make -j4 install
```

Some warnings are expected when using the `make` command, they should not cause any problems.

Stay in the build directory and set the environment variables:
(replace `3.10` in `python3.10` by your version of python)

```bash
PV_PREFIX=`pwd`/../install
export PATH=$PATH:$PV_PREFIX/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PV_PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PYTHONPATH=$PV_PREFIX/lib/python3.10/site-packages
```

### Install TTK

Go in the `ttk-lookahead` directory then run the following commands:
(replace the `4` in `make -j4` by the number of available cores on your system)

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
paraviewPath=`pwd`/../../ttk-paraview/install/lib/cmake/paraview-5.10
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install -DParaView_DIR=$paraviewPath ..
make -j4
make -j4 install
```

Stay in the build directory and set the environment variables:
(replace `3.10` in `python3.10` by your version of python)

```bash
TTK_PREFIX=`pwd`/../install
export PV_PLUGIN_PATH=$TTK_PREFIX/bin/plugins/TopologyToolKit
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$TTK_PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$TTK_PREFIX/lib/python3.10/site-packages
```
